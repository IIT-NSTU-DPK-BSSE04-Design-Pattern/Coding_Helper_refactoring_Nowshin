Description: Ensures a single instance of ProjectReader is used throughout the application, managing global state and configurations.

Design Pattern: Strategy
Location: Search
Description: Encapsulates different strategies for file processing (e.g., getFile for individual files and processProject for directories), allowing interchangeable processing logic.

Design Pattern: Template Method
Location: MethodCount (Potential Application)
Description: Can be applied to define the skeleton of file-processing logic while allowing subclasses to implement specific steps for different file types.

Design Pattern: Factory Method
Location: AverageLOC and MethodCount
Description: Could be used to create instances of project readers or line counters dynamically based on the type of project being processed.
